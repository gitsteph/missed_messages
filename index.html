                <p class="leftBorder">
                "Missed Messages" is a whimsical exploration of human connection mediated through space, time, and technology.  This piece presents a different way to send love, care, and vulnerability through the digital divide and into the community.  Take some of the kindness that cannot be captured through your cellular phone and send it through the hug-sensing vest of dapper Mr. Bear.  Press the heart and perceive the lovingly-reproduced daring kindness of a fellow traveller in the space.<br><br>
                This installation explores the personal connection that is lost to our digital selves, and encourages the search for bridges through the isolation of being far from family and friends.  Please be daring, giving, kind, and — most importantly — gentle with our prototype of a more caring future.  Created with Arduino.</p>

                <h2 class="neonBlue">Documenting the Making of</h2>
                <p>There are many photos and process notes I took while building this installation.  I tried to document virtually all the steps, tools, and technologies used along the way.  I'll share them here once I've had a chance to review and curate it all.  Check back in January 2019 if you're interested!</p>
